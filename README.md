## 👀 High-level Overview

- Navigating to the `/recover/<old PDA PublicKey>` (link generated by the extension), allows guardians to sign a transaction that validates that the recovery is valid
- If the `old PDA PublicKey` or guardian is invalid or if the guardian has already signed, it will return an error
- Otherwise, the guardian signature is captured and the result would be updated in the Chrome extension
